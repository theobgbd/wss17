_**Application of machine learning to satellite pictures**_

For this project, we will use machine learning to train neural network for a picture processing application. Our goal is to analyse satellite pictures and extract their basic features, especially roads, lakes, and urban areas. We will use both satellite and street map pictures to train a neural network.
